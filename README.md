# Ambulance_lights_detection
This is a simple lights_detection using an open_cv library
It is simple in use and highlights on the bitwise video image when the lights of ambulance are on and when are off.
Selector checks for the color change in different image modes. The code has its own comments, hope there will be no issue in implementation
